            <p className="mb-3 text-md/6 text-gray-600">
              Better Transport Queensland is a not-for-profit advocacy group consisting of
              like-minded members who want to make a positive difference for our future.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium tracking-tight">Our goals</h2>
            <p className="mb-3 text-md/6 text-gray-600">
              At Better Transport Queensland, we believe that a better future for Queenslanders
              relies on improved public, active, and freight transport.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium tracking-tight">Our mission</h2>
            <p className="mb-3 text-md/6 text-gray-600">
              To achieve our goal, we advocate for better transport in Queensland through the prioritisation
              of transport investment in active/public transport and regional/freight rail.

              Improved public and active transport are essential for moving high volumes of
              people in our quickly expanding state. It is also needed to ensure that everyone has
              equal opportunities for employment and socialising, regardless of whether one can afford
              a personal vehicle or not. We believe that no one should be forced to buy a car to get to where they need to go!

              Reducing heavy vehicle traffic on our major roads is desperately needed to improve our environmental impact.
              Moving freight by heavy rail is drastically more efficient than moving freight by single b-hauls.
              That is why we believe that the Queensland Government should be investing in and prioritising important
              heavy-rail corridors for freight, such as the North Coast Line.
