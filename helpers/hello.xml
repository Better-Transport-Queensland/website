# A Brisbane 2032 Games Transport Legacy is still possible!
*Better Transport Queensland
Tuesday, 25 March, 2025
For Immediate Release*
[wrap=summary]
The opportunity for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games to leave behind a legacy of large-scale transport infrastructure beyond Direct Sunshine Coast Rail has sadly sailed, but there is still so much that can be delivered by making smarter use of the transport infrastructure SEQ already has.
[/wrap]
## There is hope.

BTQ calls on the State Government to not abandon the idea of the Brisbane Games leaving behind a transport legacy and instead to maximise the use of SEQ&#39;s existing transport infrastructure through:

* **A SEQ Bus Network Overhaul** - Implementation of a BRT-style high-frequency services similar to the popular BUZ/Glider routes and Brisbane Trams of old. A network where buses run along the major roads every 5-10 minutes in dedicated transit lanes stopping at stations similar to the Gold Coast Light Rail stations.
* **Building Cycling Facilities at Train/Busway/Bus Stations** - Integrating cycling and transit puts high-frequency public transport within the reach of more people across a larger area than walking.
* **Building Separated Bike Lanes on Roads** - Physically separating bike lanes which are typically just painted lines on the road and/or placed on the roadside of parked cars (the door zone) represents the single greatest return on transport investment and results in significant increases in cycling in addition to higher retail turnover in local communities.
* **Maximising Train Frequencies** - Most train lines across SEQ can operate at higher frequencies without major infrastructure investment. All suburban train lines across Southeast Queensland should operate at a 15-minute frequency during off-peak hours, while interurban services should run every 30 minutes at a minimum. This change would align us with other regions, such as Perth.

### Quotes attributable to Better Transport Queensland (BTQ) spokesperson...

&quot;All levels of Government have spent over 50 years prioritising roads, freeways, and tunnels. The end result is almost 90% of trips made by motor vehicle”.

“All that SEQ has achieved is more congestion, more pollution, more ‘cost of living’ pressure, and billions spent on inefficient transport infrastructure”.

&quot;There is so much the State Government could do that doesn’t require billions to be spent on infrastructure. Transport changes that will make it easier, simpler, and quicker to move around SEQ before, during, and after the games&quot;.

“Having the majority of trips being made by car is a costly, slow, frustrating and inefficient use of the valuable transport infrastructure we already have.”

“This Olympic legacy will set up SEQ for the longer-term light rail, metro and heavy rail project desperately needed across the region”
